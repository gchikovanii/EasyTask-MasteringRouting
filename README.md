# TasksManagement

## Overview

This project showcases an advanced Angular application that emphasizes the use of Dependency Injection (DI), routing, and guards. It demonstrates how to manage and change the status of tasks, along with filtering and sorting functionalities. The project also takes advantage of Angular's modern features like signals, maps, and computed functions.

## Functionalities

- **Task Management:** Comprehensive task manipulation, including dynamic status updates.
- **Dynamic Status Update:** Change the status of tasks with real-time updates and visually reflect these changes using CSS.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Filter and sort tasks based on various criteria using query parameters.

## Features

- **Routing:** Implemented routing with dynamic, nested, and clean code splitting into multiple files.
- **Guards:** Utilized various Angular guards, including `CanDeactivate`, `CanMatch` and others, to protect routes and ensure smooth navigation.
- **Dependency Injection:** Efficient injection of services into components and other services for clean and maintainable code.
- **Service Management:** Centralized logic for status changes, filtering, and sorting.
- **Angular Signals:** Leveraged Angular's reactive programming features with signals.
- **Map and Computed Properties:** Utilized maps and computed properties to implement complex business logic.
- **Query Parameters:** Implemented query parameters for dynamic sorting and filtering of tasks.
- **Lazy Loading** for performance boost.
